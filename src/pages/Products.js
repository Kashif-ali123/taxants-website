        <h1>About Taxants</h1>
        <p>Taxants Inc. is a platform that helps in connecting students to accountants.<br></br>
It's an easy to use web app that allows students to submit documents to accountants for tax filing and other related services.<br></br>
Our simple, fast and secure platform is catered to students who want to get their taxes filed from home without the hassle of taking buses in snowy weather,<br></br> booking appointments and waiting in lines at accountant offices.</p>
<p>We started in 2018 and are now present in 6 colleges with an active database of over 1500 plus students. Our goal for 2019 is to help as many as 5000 students <br></br> across Ontario.
